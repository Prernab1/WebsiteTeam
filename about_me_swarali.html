    <h1 id="saru">Tidbits about me</h1>
    <p id="saru">Hi! My name is Swarali and I'm from (Incredible!) India - this section is not sponsored by the 'Incredible! India' ad campaign.
    <strong>*Promise*</strong> I studied neuroscience at university and researched about autism and motor disorders.
    I did not achieve anything ground breaking. I did break many test tubes though! Aside from my studies, I enjoy meditating and meeting new people. Around this time last year, I went for a meditation retreat in India and it was one of the most exciting things I have done in my life! The most exciting would have to be being in the middle of the ocean during a really terrible storm!</p>
