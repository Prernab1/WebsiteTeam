        <p>Hi! My name is Swarali and I'm from (Incredible!) India - this section is not sponsored by the 'Incredible! India' ad campaign.
      <strong>*Promise*</strong> I studied neuroscience at university and researched about autism and motor disorders.
      I did not achieve anything ground breaking. I did break a few test tubes though! Aside from my studies, I enjoy meditating and meeting new people. Around this time last year, I went for a meditation retreat in India and it was one of the most exciting things I have done in my life! The most exciting would have to be being in the middle of the ocean during a really terrible storm!</p>
      <h1 id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'>Two Fun Facts About Me</h1>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>I volunteer on Olio, a food-waste reduction platform. Till date, I have rescued over 100 kgs of food!</li>
            <li>I want to publish a book one day!</li>
          </ol>

      <h1 id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'>My Role Model</h1>
        <p>My grandmother, with whom I share my birthday! I lovingly call her <i>Akki</i>.
          She grew up with 7 siblings in a modest but disciplined household.
          Because she was born under the British rule in India, she learnt in an English school and can speak the language to this day (she's turning 70 this year!).
          She studied till 10th grade (a big deal at the time), and because she saw how hard her parents worked for her and her siblings,
          she always strove to earn money of her own and contribute to her family.
          First she sowed clothes and sold them for meagre sums of money,
          then she learnt typewriting and began an illustrious career writing legal documents in the government.
          Even after she left her job after marriage (as was common in Indian society), she saved diligently to ensure a
          flow of money when times were tough. Under her motherly shadow, my mother won several awards in drama, dance and even released a music cassette
          (modern day equivalent would be Youtube Vevo), not to mention top her boards and college degree. Of course, my mother is also my role model, but she is who she is only because of my <i>Akki</i>.</p>
