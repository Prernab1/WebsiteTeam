    <p id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'>Hi! My name is Swarali and I'm from (Incredible!) India - this section is not sponsored by the 'Incredible! India' ad campaign.
      <strong>*Promise*</strong> I studied neuroscience at university and researched about autism and motor disorders.
      I did not achieve anything ground breaking. I did break a few test tubes though! Aside from my studies, I enjoy meditating and meeting new people. Around this time last year, I went for a meditation retreat in India and it was one of the most exciting things I have done in my life! The most exciting would have to be being in the middle of the ocean during a really terrible storm!</p>
