                <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                <p>We are four girls who met each other on the Code First course. We are passionate about gender equality and believe that each of us is capable of achieving great things! All we need is belief in ourselves and the determination to succeed!</p>

                <h1>Why did we create this page?</h1>
                <p>We wanted to create an inspo-page where girls could get inspiration for who they want to be! All of us come from different backgrounds and while we are not at the height of our careers (yet!), we have unique experiences that could empower you to study what you want to, at university.</p>
