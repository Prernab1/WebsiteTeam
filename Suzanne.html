  <h1 id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'>Suzanne in a nutshell:</h1>
  <p id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'>Hi, I'm Suzanne. I'm originally from America but have moved over 30 times and lived in 4 different countries. My favourite place is London, however. I can't imagine living anywhere else. I'm one of those crazy people who still makes mixtapes, writes letters and talks to strangers on the tube. </p>

  <h1 id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'>The self-indulgent bit:</h1>
   <p id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'>I went to the Rubik's Cube World Championship and I feel the need to brag about this a little bit. And whilst it was cool, I want to add that there were only 7 girls and one of them was 7! She managed to beat some of the adults but thankfully not me. But seriously, only 7 girls? We need to represent! I'm currently learning how to solve the cubes blindfolded but it's sooo hard. You should learn too. It's fun. DO IT!</p>

  <h1 id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'>Female role model</h1>I have always admired Malorie Blackman and think she is an amazing author. I don't think I've ever had a conversation about books without recommending Noughts and Crosses. It's a classic example of how books can change people and I feel like after reading it, I was more mature. I had a better perspective on history and how not to repeat some of its darker moments. I now know how to be a better ally to friends who are persecuted and discrimnated against. It's a fantastic book. Malorie Blackman rules! READ!<p id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'></p>

  <h1 id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'>Favourite quote</h1>My favourite quote is, "Dude you're never to old for space camp". It's from the film Stranger Than Fiction, which is one of my favourite movies. I enjoy it because it reminds me to make the most of life. For me, that means learning as much as I can.

  <h1 id='individual_title' class='about_me_titles'>If you wanna reach me:</h1>Good luck! You see this is where I would insert a link to my Instagram page or Linkedin profile except I'm not on any of them. Despite loving to code, I'm a bit of a luddite I'm afraid. Also I don't want my students to find me so I try to keep a low profile online.
