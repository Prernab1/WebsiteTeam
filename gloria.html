  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I am Gloria, a young girl with innocent doe eyes but spirit of a tiger. I come from Italy but I am currently living in London to study. I am on my 3rd year of BA Business Management with Marketing and I wish to continue with a Master in Business Administration or Data analysis. I am currently working as a Sales agent and B2B marketing assistant for a company that designs and manufactures hydraulic accessories for doors - not a very feminine industry - but I like the role I am in as it allows me to promote their products, make effective presentations, negotiate with possible clients and conduct market research. What I love about marketing is the analytical part of it; the strategy, identification, planning and analysis of the qualitative and quantitative data available.</p>

 <h1>Funny facts</h1>
 <p>One funny fact about me is that when people introduce themselves I don't listen to their names as I am too busy observing them, I love observing their gesture and body language but I always end up asking for their names after months I know them. It is very embarassing!</p>
 <p>An interesting thing about me is that I've been playing football for 9 years, I love this sport but I don't support any football team and I don't like going to watch football matches to the stadium</p>

 <h1>Female role model</h1>
 <p>I don't even need a minute to think about my female role model: MY MUM! It can sound obvious but she really is a hero. She is running the biggest cheese factory in Italy, she has grown and educated 3 children, she is the kindest person I have ever met and not just people she knows but with everyone in need, she never complains about anything and she never judges anyone. Isn't all of this unbelievable? Well she is incredibly like that!</p>

<h1>Favourite quote</h1>
<p>There is no permanent reality except the reality of change; permanence is an illusion of the senses (Heraclitus).</p>
